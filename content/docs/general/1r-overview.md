# A History and Overview of R

This document will explore the history of R and other similar languages, and give a brief overview of what R is and how it should be used.

## S - A Background

Started as S in 1976 at Bell Labs, as an internal statistical analysis environment. It was rewritten in 1988 in C, and started to look like the current iteration of R. Version 4 of S was released in 1998, and is the version we use today (for s). The book *Programming with Data* by John Chambers documents this version of the language.

## Back to R

R was created in 1991 in NZ by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman, but made into a public, free software in 1995. R is managed by The R Core Group, and is still being updated.

## Features of R

Syntax of R was very similar to S, which made it easy for people to shift over to R. However, the semantics are very different. R also runs on most OS!

R itself has very sophisticated and high-quality graphics and visualizations compared ot other languages, and has a very vibrant and active community.

Since R is a free language, you have four freedoms:
* Freedom 0 - Run the program, for any purpose
* Freedom 1 - Study how it works, and adapt it to your needs
* Freedom 2 - Redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor
* Freedom 3 - Imporive the program, and release improvements to the public

## Drawbacks of R

UNforutnately, there are a couple drawbacks. R is based on a 40-year-old techonology, there is little built in support for dynamic or 3-D graphics, based on community need so if you have a method or request it may not be implemented at all, and objects generally are stored in physical memory.
