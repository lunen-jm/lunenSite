## Doks child theme

Doks is now also released as a [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hyas/doks), making it available as a dependency in the new [Doks child theme](https://github.com/h-enk/doks-child-theme). This means it's super easy to update when a new Doks version is released. Just run `npm update` â€” that's all. Of course, you can still use Doks as a starter, if that fits your use case better.
