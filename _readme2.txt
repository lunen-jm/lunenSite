Quick reference document

Production mode:
    * Currently, we're working off of the "production" branch of the git repo, since the master branch kept loading the og website
    * Just stage commits to the branch, and should be good
    * https://app.netlify.com/sites/storied-jelly-68f50d/overview
        * Rendered from production branch

Relevant links:
    * Github: https://github.com/lunen-jm/lunenSite
    * Template (GH): https://github.com/h-enk/getdoks.org

Menu:
    * Menu is autobuilt based off of .toml file found:
        * config > _default > menus.toml

Current plans:
    * Use docs for R, and then once that is figured out, try to make a new docs folder for other programming languages. May need to edit a lot of the docs stuff / copy it so everything that says "docs" says "R" instead, and vice versa
    * Showcase will be for projects and executables
    * Blog will be some fun reports I eventually try
